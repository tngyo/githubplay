Before starting off a new branch, best to update everything locally first.

git checkout main

git pull origin main


Now:


git switch -c whatever-feature-name-here


This creates a new branch or feature.

git status or git branch will confirm you are on that branch now.

If you need to get branch updates from remote repository to local: git fetch origin 

Note that fetch only download, unlike pull that updates local repo.

To update from local branch to remote repository:

git push origin whatever-feature-name-here


Subsequently:
git push


Whatever changes here will not affect the main branch before you merge it to the main branch i.e. pull request or merge request from the branch.

We can also merge branch named f3 into main with: 

git checkout main

git merge origin f3
