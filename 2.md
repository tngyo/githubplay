Before starting off a new branch, best to update everything locally first.
git checkout main
git pull origin main

Now:

git switch -c feature/whatever-feature-name-here

This is created on another a new branch or feature.

git status or git branch will confirm you are on that branch now.

git push -u orgin feature/whatever-feature-name-here

Subsequently: git push

Whatever changes here will not affect the main branch before you merge it to the main branch i.e. pull request or merge request from the branch.
