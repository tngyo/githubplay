# Playing with Git branch and merging

## Definitions: 

Origin just refers to the shortform name for the current repository instead of the long http url.

Master and main now typically refers to the same. Main is the preference. Main refers to the working primary branch of this code project.

## Why new branches?
Basically, for new features to develop before merging into the main branch.

After a new branch has been pulled and merged e.g. from the Github repository webpage, we have to do a git checkout main and git pull origin main. So we make sure we are back to working on the updated main branch.

One may not switch back to the merged previous branch with git switch -c feature/new-feature anymore.
